        <h1>Profile Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Behold! One of the largest frog species known to exist; the African bullfrog! These big guys 
            can weigh from 2 to 4 pounds, and eat just about anything that can fit in its mouth 
            (given that it is an alive meat source). 
            Given its diet, you may wonder how it's capable of eating certain creatures. The 
            answer is that they has small razor-sharp teeth, unlike most frog species. When feeding them, 
            usage of <i>tongs</i> is recommended to avoid bite to your finger (which will not only hurt you but 
            also potentially make the frog sick). These frogs also 
            have very strong legs with sharp calluses that give them incredible 
            <i>jumping and digging capabilities</i>. 
            <br><br>
            African bullfrogs are very <i>relaxed</i> in general. This means you wouldn't need to stimulate them 
            much- they can just lay back without the need of your intervention.
            Like most frogs, handling African bullfrogs is a delicate procedure. What makes handling 
            African bullfrogs more dangerous than other frogs is its physique described in the previous 
            paragraph. These frogs are laid-back animals until they are provoked. Once 
            rattled, they are <i>willing to attack</i> whatever provoked them or leap great distances to get 
            away. So <b>key tip:</b> try not to make them angry... you wouldn't like them when they're angry.
        </p>
        <h1>Environment Overview</h1>
        <div class="habitat-stats">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Capacity:</b> 10 gallon tank</li>
                <li><b>Temperature:</b> 24&#8451</li>
                <li><b>Humidity:</b> +60%</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Since African bullfrogs are laid-back animals, they don't need a climbing facilities in 
            their habitat. They do require a body of water large enough for them to swim in. It's 
            recommended to have roughly a third of the tank dedicated to fresh water. Another portion 
            of the tank should be composed of dirt/rock so that they have an area to dry off. African 
            bullfrogs also like to dig, so ensuring the dryland is large enough for excavation is a 
            key consideration when building your habitat for them. <i>Multiple zone</i> environments 
            make an excellent choice for African bullfrogs. Cleaning the tank frequently is necessary 
            as the ammonia from their waste (or as the kids say- poop) can poison them.
            <br><br>
            These formidable frogs are not the best with regards to social compatibility. It's best 
            to keep their social environment minimal. Having other African bullfrogs is acceptable, 
            but that's it. African bullfrogs are hungry animals, and are capable of eating other 
            frogs. The ideal social environment for an African bullfrog would be for it to be alone 
            or have a single partner (that's also an African bullfrog).
