        <h1>Introduction to Froggy</h1>
        <p>
            Froggy is an independant website project developed by Touseef
            Hossain with the intent of learning how to utilize HTML and
            CSS to make websites (he picked up on some Javascript and PHP too). 
            As an added bonus, he wished to learn more 
            about frogs and how to take care of them as a pet, and thought 
            this was a great opportunity to multitask. Why frogs,
            specifically? Well, it's a not-so-funny story involving coworker
            talk on break time (ie. the reason will remain unknown). <br>
            <br>This simple website consists of multiple webpages that
            discuss different aspects of domestic frog knowledge, and also
            contains a page dedicated to getting into contact with Touseef
            (in case anyone has a question, complaint, gripe,  critique, 
            statement of dissatisfaction/annoyance/protest/objection, etc.).
            This website may not contain the most information on domestic frog
            care but it was designed with the intent to ensure the visuals are 
            easy on the eyes and the website itself is easy to navigate
            through. Once you are done admiring the beauty that is this
            home page, scroll back up to the top and click one of the links
            to go to another beautiful page with different content residing
            in them! <br><br> Below are some pictures of frogs with their names
            shown if you hover your mouse over them. 
            These are some of the frogs you are able to adopt as a pet. Try clicking 
            on them to learn more about how to take care of them. 
            But if you don't know much about frogs yet, it's better 
            to scroll back up and click the "Get Started" button.

            <b>DISCLAIMER:</b> Most of the information found on
            this was retrieved from other (more qualified) sources/websites. <br> 
            As said earlier, this is an independant project whose intention 
            was to educate a little software engineer in the HTML and CSS 
            coding arts. All refernces used to create and fill the website pages 
            can be found at the bottom of each page (although not formatted).
