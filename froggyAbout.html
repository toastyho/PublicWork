           <h1>What Are Frogs?</h1>
           <p>There are 3 main categories of amphibians- one of which 
               are called frogs. These creatures are commonly known for their slimy
               skin, bulging eyes, and incredible jumping ability. Frogs are one of
               the most diverse set of animals in the world, with over 6,000 
               different speices currently existing today. Most frogs are nocturnal
               creatures, which may explain why some of you may hear croaking in 
               the middle of the night. Frogs are able to adapt in
               most environments, allowing them to reside in areas all around the 
               world (besides Antarctica- who wants to live there anyway). The only
               restriction placed on their habitat is that they require a source of 
               water for reproduction (and drinking obviously). 
           </p>
           <h1>Appearance</h1>
           <p>
               Frogs are <i>quadruped</i> animals that tend to have skinny limbs attatched
               to a central body part composed of both the torso and the head. Yes,
                this means that frogs do not have a neck and therefore cannot turn
                their head. This is where their bulging eyes come in handy. Thanks
                to this unique physiological feature, frogs are able to see
                what's behind them without having to turn their entire body around.
               <br><br>
               As said earlier, frogs are known for their slimy skin and bulging
               eyes. The 'slime' is actually a mucous coating that keeps their 
               skin moist, along with allowing them to breathe through their skin. To 
               elaborate further (for my sophisticated reader), frog skin is 
               <i>semi-permiable</i>, which means that things 
               that make contact with their skin can be absorbed into their body.
               It's important to note that not all frogs have this booger jacket. 
               Other frogs may secrete a wax-like coating around parts of their
               body that have high temperatures in order to reatin moisture in 
               that area. There are frogs that also secrete a white toxic fluid. 
               It usually comes out when the frog feels threatened. Of these 
               frogs, some of them secrete a toxin so deadly that a single droplet
               of it would be enough to kill an adult human (so maybe don't threaten
               them). 
               <br><br>
               What's also interesting about a frogs' skin is that its 
               colours and patterns vary depending on the speices. Poisonous frogs
               tend to have bright colour schemes (red, yellow, pink, etc.) to warn 
               predators that their skin is toxic. Some frogs that are not poisonous
               may also wear these colours to trick predators to stay away from them.
               Many frogs tend to have greenish and/or brownish coloured skin. 
               However, frogs are capable of changing their skin colour to blend in 
               better with their surroundings! This may come as a shock to some of
               you who thought only reptiles (namely, the chameleon) were
               capable of this feat. The colour change process isn't as effective
               as some reptiles, but it does do its intended purpose of protecting
               themselves from predators through the arts of camouflage. Their 
               colour-changes aren't necessarily a response to their physical 
               surroundings, but rather they usually occur as a reaction to a 
               temperature change. There are a small number of speices that adjust 
               their colour due to changes in light exposure and air moisture.

        <h1>Ribbit?</h1>
        <p>
            Many of us in elementary school were taught that frogs croak and 
            make the "ribbit" sound. While this is true, it isn't necessarily
            the case for all frogs. Rather than croaking, there are some frogs 
            that can grunt, whistle, chirp, or even bark! So when asked what 
            sound does a frog make, "woof" and "tweet tweet" are viable answers 
            (but let's be honest- dogs and birds don't actually sound like that
            either). 
            <br><br>
            All frog speices emit their own unique sound. There is a pocket of 
            air called the <i>vocal sac</i> found  
            around the throat area which vibrates the air inside as frogs let 
            the air out. This causes the frog to produce a sound. The ability to 
            croak is limited to male frogs, which they use to attract a mate. 
            Female frogs listen to the frequencies and depth of a male frog's 
            sound, and choose their mate based on what they like. This doesn't 
            mean that females are incapable of making sound. Female frogs produce 
            a very soft sound barely audible to the human ear. Other reasons as to 
            why frogs croak is to proclaim marked territory, warn others 
            of potential dangers, and/or display signs of distress/alarm.
        </p>
        <h1>Offspring</h1>
        <p>
            As part of the amphibian physiology, frogs reproduce by laying eggs. 
            Frog eggs need to be incubated by having them submerged in water for 
            up to 23 days (minimum 2 days for some species). Once a female frog 
            is fully matured, they are capable of laying more than 50,000 (two 
            is sufficent, however) eggs in one sitting ! The male frog typically 
            protects the eggs during their incubation process.
            <br><br>
            Depending on the speices of frogs, they can mature into a full adult 
            within 2 months to roughly 3 years. The maturity rate is also affected 
            by the temperature of the environment they are being brought up on. As  
            a newborn, frogs appear to be limbless fish-like creature with a tail. 
            They are referred to as <i>tadpoles</i>, rather than baby frogs. Tadpoles 
            need to be submerged in water up until they lose their "tail" and grow 
            some legs. They then migrate to land, and continue on with what is 
            assumed a happy froggy life.
        </p>
        <h1>So Then... What's A Toad?</h1>
        <p>
            Ah yes, toads. Many of us confuse them for frogs and vice versa. What 
            makes the two so similar in order for us to use their names 
            interchangeably? Well scientifically speaking, toads and frogs stem 
            from the same <i>anura</i>(frog category of amphibians) family. 
            Therefore, toads do share the same phisiology and habitual behaviours 
            as frogs do. There are however, a few differences that allowed them 
            to be given their own name. Here's a list of the key differences that 
            can help you figure out whether an anura is either a frog or a toad.
        </p>
        <p class="bullet-list">
            <i><b>Skin:</b></i> Frogs have a sleek, smooth, and shiny skin texture. Whereas 
            toads tend to have a lumpy skin texture (almost like warts). Frogs also 
            tend to have brighter skin color.
            <br><br>
            <i><b>Location:</b></i> Both frogs and toads can reside in most areas, but 
            toads are much more capable of withstanding dry conditions than frogs. 
            So if you see an anura amphibian on the middle of a dry pavement road, 
            chances are it's a toad.
            <br><br>
            <i><b>Legs:</b></i> Frogs have slim long legs that are better suited for 
            hopping. Toads have shorter stubby legs. Given the option, toads prefer 
            to crawl rather than hop.
            <br><br>
            <i><b>Shape:</b></i> Not only limited to the legs, frogs tend to have a more 
            slim athletic build than a toad. Toads also have a wider nose. In other 
            words, if it's a chubby boy, it's most likely a toad.
            <br><br>
            <i><b>Eggs:</b></i> Even before birth, you can determine what the creature is 
            through their eggs! If the eggs are laid in a linear fashion, 
            they belong to a toad. If the eggs are incubated in a clump, then they 
            are frog eggs.
        </p>
