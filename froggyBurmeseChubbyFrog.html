        <h1>Profile Overview</h1>
        <p>
            These <i>docile</i> animals are formerly known as <i>Asian painted frogs</i>, but have 
            been given an informal (and colloquial) name through the affection of those 
            involved in pet trade. Chubby frogs have <i>big appetites</i> so ensuring they have 
            food available most of the day is recommended. They adapt to their surrounding environment 
            very quickly even 
            when the environment itself is not ideal (i.e. they aren't picky). Chubby 
            frogs are <i>nocturnal</i> animals, but fret not- they aren't hyperactive so your sleep 
            should not be affected. Overall, chubby frogs have low requirements making them 
            very good choices to start off with if this is your first time adopting a frog.
            <br><br>
            Given their big appetite, chubby frogs may mistake your finger for food! Don't worry, their 
            bites don't hurt (it's more cute if anything). Like most frogs, handling should be kept to a 
            minimum. It's important to be gentle with them because when threatened, they will secrete an 
            unpleasant mucous from its body. It isn't poisonous, but it does smell bad.
        </p>
        <h1>Environment Overview</h1>
        <div class="habitat-stats">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Capacity:</b>15 gallon tank</li>
                <li><b>Temperature:</b> 20&#8451- 26&#8451</li>
                <li><b>Humidity:</b> ~70%</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Chubby frogs with their stubby limbs, aren't great at jumping. Instead, they like to climb 
            and dig around for fun. Greater heights in a tank are ideal for chubby frogs (room for 
            climbing), but are not necessary. As a rule of thumb, 10 inches high should be good enough. 
            A simple <i>terrestrial</i> enclosure should be more than enough for a chubby frog. They 
            adapt to cptivity easily, and therfore don't require a lot of commodities to survive. Having 
            a water source just large enough for them to soak in, along with "diggable" land material 
            are the only things that could be deemed necessary for them (pretty much things that all 
            frogs need). Inclusion of <i>hiding spots</i> for chubby frogs will be better for them 
            mentally.
            <br><br>
            Asian painted frogs get along with others of its own kind. They are docile frogs, so it is 
            possible for them to get along with other species. However, chubby frogs are hungry animals, 
            so it is also possible for them to eat other species (especially those that are smaller than 
            it). It's best to just have chubby frogs associate with one another. If you are looking to 
            breeding them, you will find better luck doing that in the wild than in a domestic 
            environment.
