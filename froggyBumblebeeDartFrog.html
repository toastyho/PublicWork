        <h1>Profile Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The bumblebee poison dart frog is known to be <i>curious</i> and somewhat <i>intelligent</i> by nature. 
            They enjoy exploring their srurroundings, making them a <i>very active</i> species of frog. Their 
            colour scheme resembles that of a bumblebee (may be the reason why they got their name) 
            and they have wide flattened feet that are suitable for climbing and gripping. Among 
            the poison dart frogs that exist, bumblebees are considered one of the <i>loudest</i>, so do take 
            that into consideration when deciding on which frog to adopt. However, they are <i>diurnal</i> 
            (active during the day), which means noise at night won't be a problem.
            <br><br>
            As its full name suggests, the bumblebee posion dart frog does <i>secrete a toxin</i> through its 
            skin. Apparently, the toxin also tastes really bad (shoutout to whoever bit that bullet).
            The toxin does weaken over time in captivity, but the fact remains that they have delicate 
            skin. Therefore, the physical handling of these frogs should be kept to a minimum. There 
            isn't much need of looking after them anyway, given their intelligent nature.

        <h1>Environment Overview</h1>
        <div class="habitat-stats">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Capacity:</b> 10-15 gallon tank per adult pair</li>
                <li><b>Temperature:</b> 21&#8451- 24&#8451</li>

        <p>
            Naturally found in the rainforest terrain of Venezuela, bumblebee dart frogs are found 
            near ponds of water and like to be off the ground. This means that <i>aboreal</i> enclosures 
            are a good choice for their habitat. Rather than focusing on real plant decor, it's better to 
            have facilities where bumblebees can climb and jump onto, along with a small pond within the 
            tank. Bumblebees don't require a lot of light and also don't do well in higher temperatures. 
            So ensure whatever light source you use to light up the tank does not generate excess heat.
            <br><br>
            Bumblebee dart frogs are social creatures, so it's recomended to adopt more than one of 
            them. As the compatibility section states, bumblebees should be adopted in male/female 
            pairs as females tend to get aggressive with other females. This means as they age, it's 
            better to keep pairs separated. Given their poisonous physiology, it's better to not 
            keep other species of frogs within the same environment.
