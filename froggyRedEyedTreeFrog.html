        <h1>Profile Overview</h1>
        <p>
            With their beady red eyes, bright green skin, blue and yellow body patterns, and orange 
            webbed feet, red-eyed tree frogs are quite the captivating species among the anura group. 
            They naturally reside in tropical areas such as Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama. Red-eyes 
            are <i>skittish</i> due to them being prey to many animals in their natural habitat. They 
            are <i>nocturnal</i>, but that doesn't mean you won't get to see them in action when you're 
            awake. These frogs are <i>active</i>, which gives them the drive to move around and explore 
            their surroundings.  
            <br><br>
            As said earlier, red-eyd tree frogs are skittish animals, so handling them in a delicate 
            manner is a must. This doesn't mean that you can't get close to it and observe its 
            behaviour. They tend to activate their flight system through threatening sounds and/or 
            physical contact. 
        </p>
        <h1>Environment Overview</h1>
        <div class="habitat-stats">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Capacity:</b> 15-20 gallon tank</li>
                <li><b>Temperature:</b> 24&#8451- 30&#8451</li>
                <li><b>Humidity:</b> 60%- 80%</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Red-eyed tree frogs thrive in rainforest environments, so their domestic habitat needs to 
            replicate that tropical climate. The tank needs to be large in terms of height and overall 
            size, since they like to move and jump around a lot. Large <i>aboreal</i> enclosures are 
            the best choice for tree frogs. The water source should be big enough for tree frogs to 
            soak in, but not enough to swim in (swimming leads to drowning for them). In rainforest 
            settings, the temperature and humidity levels change a good amount throughout the cycle 
            of a day. To ensure health of a red-eyed tree frog, drop the temperature and humditity 
            levels to 21&#8451 and approximately 60% humditity at night time. To help with moderating 
            these levels, the purchase of a <i>digital thermometer</i> is recomended. Tree frogs 
            require <i>UVB lighting</i> as well.
            <br><br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Make sure to do plenty of research on their habitat construction as it is essential
            for their survival
            <br><br>
            Tree frogs in general, are sociable creatures, so it is fine for you to have other tree frogs 
            (same or different) in the same enclosure as your red-eyed tree frog. Their fearful nature 
            only kicks in if you have other pets- they can cause tree frogs stress. If you are planning 
            to have more than one tree frog in an enclosure, make sure the habitat itself is big enough 
            to accomodate these active animals. Each tree frog should have their own space.
