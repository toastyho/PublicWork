        <h1>Taking Care Of Your Froggy</h1>
        <p>
            Frogs are definitely cute animals (if you don't think so, 
            re-evaluate life), and some can be domesticated. These two facts  
            enable frogs to be suitable choices for pets (yes, pets need to be 
            cute). Frogs are however, a bit more difficult to take care of than 
            other pets. Research on pet frog care is definitely required prior to 
            adoption for the sake of both the frog's and owners' safety.
            Before going out to a pet store/animal shelter to 
            adopt your first frog, here are a few things you should know about 
            frog care:

                    When considering what kind of frog you want, aesthetics should 
                    not be the only criteria (as tempting as it may be). Firstly, 
                    some frogs should not be taken in as pets (no matter what) as 
                    they either require a natural wild environment for surviaval, 
                    are endangered, or are very poisonous. Among the frogs 
                    that you may adopt, you'll need to <b>consider your living 
                    conditions</b>, <b>time dedication</b>, and <b>expectations</b>. 
                    Some frogs require 
                    more attention and more strict environmental conditions in order 
                    for it to remain healthy. When the time comes to make a decision 
                    on the species of frog, be sure to have done the research on that 
                    specific frog to see if you have the facilities to support it.

                    Since frogs are known to reside in many different areas around 
                    the world, there is no universal style of habitat that all frogs 
                    can safely live in. There are factors found in species of frogs 
                    that make them unique, and therefore require unique conditions 
                    for their habitat. Some examples of such factors are their 
                    jumping ability, size, and ratio of living on land vs. water.
                    Yes, this does mean you need to do <b>research</b> 
                    on what kind of <b>habitat</b> supports your desired frog. 
                    Frog habitats do need to be <b>built from scratch</b>, but 
                    there are some general styles that serve as a foundation as to 
                    how the habitat needs to be built (see more on habitats below).

                    Frogs are <b>sensitive</b> animals. They can contract and carry 
                    diseases that could potentially be transmitted to humans and/or 
                    other pets if not handled properly. When <b>handling</b> a frog, 
                    you should wear moistened latex (*wink wink) or vinyl
                     <b>gloves</b> so that 
                    you avoid any possibiity of contracting disease. More 
                    importantly, the gloves should be worn in order to protect the 
                    frog because chemicals from a human's hand (like oils, soaps, 
                    moisturizers, etc.) can irritate a frogs skin, resulting in 
                    them getting ill and/or contracting a disease. So it is possible 
                    to give a frog a disease, and then contract it from the frog 
                    (a great "reap what you sow" moment). Before bringing a frog 
                    home, it's recommended to take it to a vet to see if they have 
                    any <b>harmful transmittable diseases</b>. If they do, you would 
                    need to quarentine them.

                    Frogs are <b>carnivorous</b> animals, which can come off as a surprise 
                    given their size and cuteness. Furthermore, they enjoy eating their 
                    food alive! <b>Crickets</b> are the staple food that frogs enjoy. Other 
                    insects frogs might like are worms and 
                    fireflies. There are some frogs that are capable of eating small 
                    rodents (though it shouldn't be consumed on a regular basis)! 
                     <b>Feeding the food</b> 
                    itself <b>vitamin/mineral suplements</b> helps with a frog's diet (see more

                    Frogs are <b>social creatures</b> (with other frogs- not humans). Most frogs (not all)
                    like to have some company as it is better for them mentally. So why not give your
                    one froggy a friend or two (or three)? There are some frogs that <b>can interact
                    with other speices </b> 
                    but there are also some that cannot. Again, research must be done 
                    prior to the adoption process. Do understand that it will 
                    get <b>more expensive</b> to take care of multiple frogs as it would entail larger 
                    habitats and more live food. There are a few frogs that are capable of resorting 
                    to canibalism, so it's best to keep them alone or the very least separated from 
                    the other frogs.

        <h1>Frog Habitats</h1>
        <p>
            There are various types of habitats that accomodate for the different types of frogs 
            out there. With regards to the dimensions and environmental layout of the enclosure, 
            you need to consider the frog's physiology and habits. There are five main types of 
            habitats that could be taken into consideration. Some of these styles can be combined 
            with another, if you have the resources. Click on the tabs below to learn more of each 
            style of habitat.

                Considered one of the simplest layouts for a frog habitat. The 
                environment is perfect for frogs that naturally live in a dry climate setting (works 
                for most toads).

                Pretty much a fish tank, but for frogs. But a frog cannot share a habitat 
                with a fish because well... there's a good chance the fish will dissapear. An aquatic 
                environment is best suited only for aquatic frogs (pretty straightforward).

                A very good choice for most frogs species. As the name suggests, 
                multiple zone habitats have different enclosures that consist of different environments. 
                These enclosures are connected, allowing the frog to move from zone to zone. These 
                habitats are more expensive but accomodate most frogs' needs.

                The enclosures of these environments are grand in terms of height (the picture is 
                deceiving). These tanks are designed this way to give frogs that like to jump/climb 
                the space to do so.

                If you have enough space in your backyard, an installation of a pond would be 
                beneficial to frog species that are native to pond areas. Other frogs and insects not 
                native to ponds can be engdangered in the setting however.

        <h1 class="under-tab">Habitat Conditions</h1>
        <p>
            When it comes to aesthetics and features of a frog habitat (ie. soil type, number of 
            climbing trees, rock positioning), you have compete creative control.
            However, you are not merely just the interior decorator, but also the interior designer 
            (yes, there's a difference). As an interior designer, you need to ensure that certain 
            attributes of your frog habitat meet these conditions:
            <br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Most of these conditions will be automatically met if you are able to create 
            a pond habitat.
        </p>
        <p class="bullet-list">
            <i><b>Humidity:</b></i> Frogs require higher humidity levels (than a standard room level) in 
            order to keep their skin healthy. <i>Misting</i> is known to the best way to increase 
            humidity in an enclosure. Using a misting machine, fogger, or a simple spray bottle 
            (spray often) are ways you can implement misting.
            <br><br>
            <i><b>Temperature/Lighting:</b></i> There is a certain temperature range that frogs require 
            in their habitat in order for them to remain healthy and active. Some frogs require <i>UVB 
            lighting</i> for that good ol' vitamin D3 exposure. <i>Heating pads</i> at the bottom/sides 
            of the enclosure or a <i>basking lamp</i> placed at the top of the enclosure, are both good 
            options for raising the temperature in a frog habitat.
            <br><br>
            <i><b>Water:</b></i> One of the key things to moderate is the water in a frog habitat. 
            Frogs absorb the oxygen in water (this is how aquatic frogs 
            stay submerged in water for great periods of time), but can also absorb other elements found 
            in the water if it is contaminated. Chlorine-based tap water, for example, should not be used 
            as the water source for a frog habitat because it would result in the frog absorbing the 
            chlorine through its semi-permiable skin (not a good thing). Frogs prefer <i>neutral pH water</i>  
            with <i>natural minerals</i>.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight-text">
            There are more nifty tools that can help with raising a frog! Doing more research is 
            encouraged if you are interested. Most of the items mentioned can be found at your 
            local pet store (given that they sell frogs).
        </p>
        <h1>Frog Diet</h1>
        <p>
            Frogs don't have teeth, so they need to swallow their live food 
            whole. No vegetarian meal is part of a 
            frog's diet. There is however, a study that found that some frogs 
            in hotter areas shift to a omnivorian/vegetarian diet due to 
            climate change. For more details on that, click 
            <a href="https://www.earth.com/news/amazing-amphibians-eat-vegetarian/">
            here</a>. The amount of food fed to a frog in a day varies, so some 
            trial-and-error is required for finding the right amount. 
            Three crickets a day is a good start. From there, you can gauge whether 
            to give more or less depedning on how much the frog eats. For a balanced 
            diet, it is advised to change their meals up every now and then, and to 
            coat supplements (often referred as <i>dusting</i>) on the food before 
            feeding them to the frog. <br><br>
            The most common way of dusting is to place crickets (or whichever insect) in a 
            bag, add the supplement powder in, then shake the closed up bad for a few seconds 
            (dusting is pretty much a cricket frat party). Calcium supplements should be 
            coated on the frog's 
            primary source of food for pretty much all their meals (for strong bone growth). 
            Vitamin supplements are not as necessary, so 1-2 times a week is a good rate. 
            This guideline is a good starting point for feeding frogs, but may need to be 
            adjusted depedning on the species of frog that is under domestic care.

        <h1>Are Frogs Right For You?</h1>
        <p>
            Now that you know more about how to take care of a frog, the one question remaining is: 
            "should I take frog in as a pet"? You might be wondering why this question wasn't addressed 
            near the beginning of this page. Well, Touseef wanted you to read. That's it. No other 
            reason. If you made it to this section without reading anything, please scroll back up and 
            read (he worked somewhat hard on this). If you choose not to... well, okay then. Anyways,
