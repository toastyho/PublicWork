        <h1>Profile Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The white-lipped tree frog is given its name due to the white line drawn out at its bottom 
            lip (and hopefully for that one reason only). It also goes by the name, <i>giant tree frog</i>,  
            since it is rather large in size (can reach 5+ inches- that's large for a jumper), and it can 
            be found in many tree-abundant areas. It is very far from being endangered due to its 
            <i>ability to adapt</i> to various climates and environments.
            <br><br>
            Handling of the white-lipped tree frog should be minimal as it does get stressed out easily 
            from human contact and can contract an illness/disease from excessive contact. The reason 
            why the care level is set to intermediate is because of its inreased need of 
            resources. White-lips need more food and a larger habitat due to its size, making it 
            <i>more expensive</i>  
            (than other frogs) to take care of in the long run. It is almost impossible to 
            differentiate between male and female white-lipped tree frogs, which may become problematic 
            if you are planning on breeding them.

            The giant tree frog originates from Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. These frogs 
            can be found in gardens, parks, forests, and fields. Basically, the white-lipped tree frog 
            is not picky with regards to its living environment. What's necessary for it is space for 
            it to move/jump around. An <i>aboreal</i> environment is good height-wise, but a mix with a 
            <i>mutiple-zone</i> environment is also a good choice because it provides more space to it, 
            along with giving it options on where it can play around. Make sure the tanks have climbable 
            decor, since they are aboreal animals. For jungle creatures like this one, <i>UVB lighting</i> 
            is needed in order to replicate their natural habitat.
            <br><br>
            Giant tree frogs don't necessarily need companions, but it's always nice to have a friend, 
            right? These frogs are relatively docile by nature, and thus can get along with other 
            species of frogs. Be sure to research whether the other species of frog are compatible 
            with white-lipped tree frogs.
